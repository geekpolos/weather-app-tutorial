I wrote this text file to put some personal notes together. 

##How to push local environment to GitHub and Heroku.
1) This step isn't necessary, but it helps me know what files are ready to be added. 
Git status

2) Git add .
Then, I can add all files using the dot operator or I can choose individual files. 

3) Git push
Once I've added the files, I push the changes to my GitHub repo. 

4) Git push heroku master
Finally, I push my changes to heroku. 

These steps are made available because I've setup SSH keys with GitHub and Heroku.
